    "Curious, social, and full of life — prairie dogs are like tiny ground-dwelling comedians. With their funny squeaks, curious stares, and group-loving attitude, they’re one of the most entertaining exotic pets you’ll ever own. Owning a prairie dog means understanding their need for attention and enrichment. They love tunnels, dig boxes, and interaction with their owners. With proper care, they bond strongly and can even learn simple tricks or come when called. They need space, time, and love — but in return, they’ll fill your home with laughter and energy.",
  longDescription: `<p>Prairie dogs are often admired for their endearing nature and engaging presence. Although their name suggests otherwise, they are actually rodents and share a close relationship with flying squirrels. They have a long history of being kept in captivity, and over time have become well known for their lively and individual personalities. It’s common for enthusiasts to care for more than one prairie dog, with small same-sex groupings generally recommended. When provided with the proper setting, prairie dogs can be a fascinating and enjoyable species to keep. Prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are intelligent, highly social rodents native to the grasslands of North America. These little chatterboxes thrive in groups, constantly communicating through their unique barks and squeaks. While small in size, they have huge personalities — playful, affectionate, and always curious about what you’re up to.</p>

Think of them as the more chill, pocket-sized cousins of sugar gliders. These are a new addition to the EA Ranch family, we will likely have very few available opposum babies until we are able to expand our colony, so please be patient with us.",
  longDescription: `<p>The short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) is a South American marsupial that’s quickly becoming a fan favorite among exotic pet lovers. Known also as the Brazilian opossum or rainforest opossum, as they are generally found south of the Amazon River, in southern, central, and western Brazil. They may also be found in eastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and in northern Argentina, inhabiting rainforest environments, scrubland, and agricultural land, often entering man-made structures, such as houses. They’re low-odor, gentle, and surprisingly easy to handle once they get to know you. With their big eyes and prehensile tails, they’re both fascinating and adorable to watch.</p>
<p>Unlike many marsupials, short-tailed opossums don’t have pouches — instead, their babies cling to their mother’s belly for warmth. They’re solitary animals by nature, preferring to live alone but bond closely with their human caretakers. Give them a warm habitat, a running wheel, and some tasty insects, and you’ll have one happy little explorer. While rarely aggressive toward humans, they have sharp teeth and may nip if they feel cornered or threatened. They do not typically "play dead" like the North American opossum; instead, they are more likely to hiss or hide if stressed.</p>
<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>They’re one of the few marsupials without a pouch!</li>
  <li>Short-tailed opossums can use their tails to grasp objects — like tiny monkeys.</li>
  <li>They’re excellent climbers and love to explore at night.</li>
  <li>They help control bugs around the house (natural pest patrol!)</li>
  <li>They groom themselves constantly — surprisingly clean little creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p> If you want an exotic pet that’s unique, quiet, and doesn’t need constant attention, this one’s a gem. Great for apartment owners or night owls looking for a quirky companion. <a href="/contact.html">Reach out</a> to grab yours and learn more about setup options!</p>`,

    "These baby Chinchillas for sale are the softest pets in the world! This is due to their luxurious fur that is  very dense but fine, feeling like you are holding a cotton little cloud. Chinchillas have big personalities and develop strong bonds with their owners which makes them very personable and unique pets. Fluffy, fast, and full of character — chinchillas are tiny clouds of energy. They’re super soft (literally the softest fur on Earth), love to jump, and make for an adorable low-odor exotic pet.",
  longDescription: `<p>The chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) is a small, high-energy rodent from the Andes Mountains. Famous for its plush fur and lovable antics, this little furball is both adorable and easy to care for. Their incredibly thick, soft fur ranges from solid white to solid black, in various grays and browns. They’re social, thrive in pairs, and love their daily dust baths — which help keep their fur soft and clean.</p>
<p>Chinchillas are crepuscular, meaning they’re most active at dawn and dusk. They need roomy cages, shelves for jumping, and chew toys to wear down their teeth. Once they trust you, they’re affectionate, gentle, and endlessly entertaining. Emotional stress can lead to physical symptoms, so one should be aware of the pet's needs before choosing to provide a home for them.</p>
<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Chinchilla fur is so dense that fleas can’t live in it!</li>
  <li>Dust baths are used for chinchillas to remove any oil or moisture from their thick fur; this will also help keep their fur soft. You should not bathe a chinchilla in water as this may cause them to lose their fur.</li>
  <li>They can jump up to six feet in the air — serious agility for such small creatures.</li>
  <li>Chinchilla fur is considered the softest in the world: 30 times softer than human hair! Chinchillas also have 50 or more hairs per follicle as opposed to humans, who only have one</li>
  <li>They can live 15–20 years with proper care — that’s commitment!</li>
</ul>
<p>With their curious nature and low-maintenance care, chinchillas are perfect for families or first-time exotic pet owners. Want to add a little fluff and fun to your life? <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> to reserve your chinchilla today.</p>`,

<p><strong>Marmoset Monkeys</strong> (<em>Callithrix jacchus</em>), often called “finger monkeys,” are small New World primates native to Brazil’s coastal forests. Known for their expressive faces and boundless curiosity, these tiny dynamos form strong emotional bonds with their caretakers and thrive in enriched, social environments.

Baby pygmy marmosets are tiny enough to cling to your finger, much like other monkeys cling to tree branches; hence the nickname.</p>
<p>With their quick intelligence, Marmosets can recognize their owners, learn feeding routines, and even mimic certain gestures. They’re active from sunrise to sunset — climbing, leaping, and exploring everything in sight. A spacious indoor-outdoor enclosure with natural perches, branches, and climbing ropes is ideal for their wellbeing.</p>

  longDescription: `<p>Prehensile-tailed porcupines (family Erethizontidae) are distinctive New World rodents with a tail adapted to grasp branches, enabling agile arboreal movement. Native to tropical and subtropical forests, these porcupines are mostly nocturnal, slow-moving but surprisingly surefooted. Their quills are mixed with coarse hair and act as a deterrent rather than a primary offense mechanism. Despite popular belief, they can not throw their quills. But, when they are scared, they puff up their quills. If they are touched when puffed up, their quills will release.</p>

<p>In captivity, a large, secure enclosure with climbing structures, multiple resting platforms, and an array of chewable branches will keep them physically and mentally healthy. Their diet should emphasize fresh leafy browse, twigs, fiber-rich pellets, and controlled fruit allowances. Special attention should be paid to dental wear; provide appropriate gnawing materials to avoid malocclusion. Porcupines are the 3rd largest rodent in the world behind the capybara and the beaver. A male porcupine is a ”boar” and a female is a “sow”, young porcupines are referred to as 'porcupi'.</p>

<p>Medical care: monitor for external parasites, quill breakage/abrasions, and dental issues. Porcupines can be shy at first but will show curiosity with proper enrichment and patient handling. These animals are fantastic for interpretive exhibits — visitors are captivated by the prehensile tail and slow, deliberate feeding behavior.</p>

<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The tail is muscular and prehensile — they literally hang on with it while eating.</li>
  <li>They are primarily folivores — leaves and bark form a large part of their diet.</li>
  <li>Porcupine quills are released when predators make contact; a porcupine doesn’t “throw” them.</li>
  <li>They mark territory with scent glands near the base of the tail.</li>
  <li>Young porcupines are capable climbers soon after birth and learn from maternal examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each porcupine sold includes a full husbandry sheet and recommended vet contacts. Shipping is handled via climate-controlled transport and includes a pre-shipment health exam.

    "Libyan Striped Weasels — sleek, quick, and inquisitive mustelids with striking facial and flank striping. With a slender body and distinctive stripes along its back, this baby weasel's coloration is typically a mix of black, dark brown, and white, creating a striped pattern. Best suited for licensed collections, educational institutions, or experienced private keepers familiar with small carnivore care.",
  longDescription: `<p>The Libyan Striped Weasel also known as Saharan Striped Polecat (Mustela libyca - common name used regionally) is a small, slender carnivore adapted to arid and semi-arid habitats of North Saharan Africa and adjacent regions. These weasels are active, highly inquisitive, and require careful management in captivity due to high metabolic needs and behavioral complexity typical of mustelids.</p>

<p>Housing should emphasize climbing opportunities, denning boxes, and escape-proofing; weasels are notorious for squeezing through small gaps. Diet is carnivorous and should mirror natural prey: high-protein whole-prey feeding (where legal and appropriate), supplemented with specially formulated small-carnivore diets and calcium/vitamin profiles recommended by an exotic veterinarian. Social structure varies by species — some weasels are solitary, others tolerate pairs; always research the exact species and consult our team for compatibility guidance.</p>

<p>Health notes: mustelids can develop adrenal or metabolic conditions if diet and stress are not carefully managed. Veterinary care must be provided by an exotics specialist. These animals are excellent for conservation messaging about North African ecosystems; their speed and curiosity make them compelling live ambassadors if handled ethically and legally.</p>

<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Weasels have extremely high metabolic rates and often need multiple small meals per day.</li>
  <li>Their slender bodies allow them to pursue prey into tight burrows.</li>
  <li>Many Mustelids are highly intelligent and require enrichment to prevent stress behaviors.</li>
  <li>Striping patterns aid in camouflage in arid, scrubby habitats.</li>
  <li>They are expert hunters — small, alert, and lightning quick on their feet.</li>
</ul>

    "Our baby prairie dogs are like tiny ground-dwelling comedians, with their funny squeaks, curious stares, and group-loving attitude, they’re one of the most entertaining exotic pets you’ll ever own. Owning a prairie dog means understanding their need for attention and enrichment. They love tunnels, dig boxes, and interaction with their owners. With proper care, they bond strongly and can even learn simple tricks or come when called. They need space, time, and love — but in return, they’ll fill your home with laughter and energy.",
  longDescription: `<p>Prairie dogs are often admired for their endearing nature and engaging presence. Although their name suggests otherwise, they are actually rodents and share a close relationship with flying squirrels. They have a long history of being kept in captivity, and over time have become well known for their lively and individual personalities. It’s common for enthusiasts to care for more than one prairie dog, with small same-sex groupings generally recommended. When provided with the proper setting, prairie dogs can be a fascinating and enjoyable species to keep. Prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are intelligent, highly social rodents native to the grasslands of North America. These little chatterboxes thrive in groups, constantly communicating through their unique barks and squeaks. While small in size, they have huge personalities — playful, affectionate, and always curious about what you’re up to.</p>

Small marsupials covered with a beautiful golden brown coat, have light pink ears, pretty much the cutest eyes you've ever seen and big personalities! We have Male and female opposums perfect for those who want something different from the usual exotic pets.",
  longDescription: `<p>These Baby Woolly Opossums are kept at our spectacular facility with a great staff that is ready to serve you. We are USDA licensed and inspected for over 25+ years. They make fascinating pets for experienced exotic owners, offering playful interactions and endless curiosity. When properly socialized, they’re gentle, engaging, and entertaining to watch — like little furry acrobats on the move!</p>
<p>Derby’s Woolly Opossums (Caluromys derbianus) are agile, tree-loving marsupials from Central and South America. With their soft, wool-like fur and curious eyes, they’re as cute as they are clever. These nocturnal climbers thrive in warm, humid environments and love snacking on fruits, insects, and small amounts of nectar.</p>
<h4>Key Temperament and Behavior Traits</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solitary and Nocturnal:</strong> These opossums are naturally solitary and active at night, preferring to sleep during the day. This makes their active hours difficult to align with a typical human schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Wary and Anxious:</strong> They possess an innate wariness and anxiety around humans. While they can form a bond of dependency with caretakers if socialized from a very young age, this is not the same as the affection found in domesticated pets.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Biting:</strong> If they feel cornered or threatened, they may bite, hiss, or growl in defense. They are not inherently aggressive but act on instinct when scared.</li>
<li><strong>Agile Climbers:</strong> They are adept climbers and explorers, requiring a large enclosure with plenty of climbing opportunities to satisfy their natural arboreal behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Limited</strong> Trainability: While some opossums can be litter-box trained, their capacity for other forms of training is very limited. They retain their wild instincts even when raised in captivity.</li>
<li><strong>Curious:</strong> They are curious animals and will explore their surroundings, which means an owner would need to "opossum-proof" their home when the pet is out of its enclosure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>They’re one of the few opossums with prehensile tails for gripping branches.</li>
  <li>Females carry their young in a pouch, just like kangaroos!</li>
  <li>They can leap up to six feet in a single bound.</li>
  <li>In the wild, they help pollinate plants by carrying pollen on their fur.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re after a rare, interactive exotic with charm to spare, these Woolly Opossums are a top pick. Located in south Texas we ship or offer pickup. Come see us and pick up your baby in person if that is preferred.

  longDescription: `<p>Home-bred hamsters are healthier, happier, and friendlier than pet shop hamsters. They’re raised in a loving environment, giving them the best possible start in life. We spend hours each day socialising with these babies to ensure they become loving and playful companions. When you adopt from us, you’ll also receive:	A guide to what food they eat •	Their favourite treats •	Notes on each hamster’s unique personality</p>
    <p><strong>Fancy Dwarf Hamsters</strong> are small, friendly, and full of attitude. Unlike the larger Syrian hamsters, dwarfs are social and can sometimes be kept in same-sex pairs. They’re fast, active, and love running on wheels or digging elaborate tunnels in soft bedding. Our hamster babies may take a short time to warm up to new people but once settled they become confident, entertaining and surprisingly photogenic. Their playfulness is  a joy to watch and plenty of personality packed into very small bodies.</p>
    <p>Available in a range of coat colors and patterns — from pearl to sable to albino — each hamster is a unique little character. They’re easy to care for, inexpensive to feed, and live comfortably in compact enclosures.</p>
    <p>These little buddies are perfect for first-time pet owners or anyone wanting a cute low-maintenance companion. Their quick movements and curious nature make them a joy to watch and handle (especially when they stuff their cheeks full of snacks).</p>
    <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Dwarf hamsters can run over 5 miles in one night on their wheel!</li>
      <li>They store food in their cheek pouches and hoard it like tiny dragons.</li>
      <li>Despite their size, they have big personalities — and some even learn their names.</li>
      <li>Most hamsters clean themselves more often than cats do!</li>
    </ul>

    "The Madagascar superstar — baby ring-tailed lemurs are playful, affectionate, and absolutely irresistible. Hand-raised and socialized for friendly, interactive companionship.",
  longDescription: `<p>Our passion for lemurs was sparked by Clover, a remarkable ring-tailed lemur who continues to thrive in a custom-designed habitat with sweeping views of our 1,800+ acre ranch reserve. Her impact went far beyond companionship, shaping a purpose-driven vision centered on ethical breeding practices, wildlife conservation, public education, and thoughtful, responsible placement.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Ring-Tailed Lemur</strong> (<em>Lemur catta</em>) is one of the most recognizable primates on the planet — and for good reason. With their striking black-and-white tails and cheeky personalities, these lemurs bring pure joy and energy into any exotic setup. Native to Madagascar, they’re known for their tight-knit social bonds and curious, mischievous behavior.</p>
    <p>Our hand-raised babies are socialized from birth for friendly, people-loving temperaments. They thrive on fruits, vegetables, and specialized primate chow, and require spacious enclosures with climbing branches and enrichment toys. Lemurs love interaction and playtime, and with consistent handling, they form lifelong bonds with their owners.</p>
    <p>With proper care, ring-tailed lemurs live 18–22 years and are suitable for experienced exotic owners or licensed facilities. Their intelligence and expressiveness make them one of the most rewarding primates to raise.</p>
    <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lemurs communicate using over 25 different vocal sounds!</li>
      <li>They love sunbathing — often sitting upright like tiny yogis to warm up.</li>
      <li>Their tails can grow longer than their bodies, used for balance and signaling.</li>
      <li>They’re matriarchal — females rule the troop!</li>

Our kangaroo & wallaby babies are typically presold, and any remaining babies usually sell out fast. Contact us to join the waiting list for red kangaroos and Bennett’s wallabies. All of our joeys will be adopted out as bottle babies.",
  longDescription: `<p>The Bennett’s wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) is a small kangaroo species from Tasmania and Australia’s coastal forests. Graceful, curious, and surprisingly gentle, these marsupials make unique and affectionate companions when properly cared for. However, they are inherently timid, easily stressed by change or loud noises (like barking dogs), and possess a strong flight instinct when startled. They are also curious and playful, though males may engage in "boxing" behavior that needs early discouragement. They love open spaces, fresh grass, and a safe outdoor enclosure.</p>
  <p>Wallabies are herbivores, feeding on grasses and leafy greens, and they form strong bonds with their caretakers. With their bounding hops and curious gazes, they’re a daily dose of joy. While they require time and space, they reward owners with affection and plenty of character.</p>
  <h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Wallabies are close cousins of kangaroos, just smaller and cuter!</li>
    <li>They can leap up to 6 feet high in a single bound.</li>
    <li>They’re excellent swimmers — yes, hopping isn’t their only skill.</li>
    <li>They’re crepuscular — most active at dawn and dusk.</li>
    <li>Baby wallabies are called “joeys” and love to snuggle in pouches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bennett’s wallabies are amazing for dedicated owners who want something exotic, adorable, and full of life.

    "Mom & Baby Two-Toed Sloth Pair — a rare, slow-living duo perfect for experienced exotic keepers and sanctuaries. These calm arboreal mammals are ideal for educational programs or a carefully-managed private collection. Expect gentle personalities, long lifespans, and specialized care.",
  longDescription: `<p>The Two-Toed Sloth (genus Choloepus) is an arboreal mammal native to Central and South American tropical forests. This listing pairs a mother with her dependent baby — an ideal unit for breeders, educational exhibits, or licensed private keepers who can provide long-term, species-appropriate care. Two-toed sloths are known for their deliberate movements, low metabolic rates, and unique adaptations for life hanging in the canopy.</p>

<p>In captivity, two-toed sloths require large, vertically oriented enclosures with abundant branches for climbing and resting at varied heights. Temperature stability (mid 70s–80s °F), high humidity, and gentle daily handling routines help maintain health and wellbeing. Their diet in managed care is varied: fresh leafy greens, specially formulated herbivore diets, seasonal fruits offered in moderation, and supplemental vitamins/minerals. Veterinary oversight is essential — sloths are prone to stress-related illness if their environment or routine is disrupted.</p>

<p>From a conservation & husbandry standpoint, sloths are best kept by permit-holding, experienced teams. Breeding sloths in captivity is slow and requires expertise; a mother-and-baby pair simplifies social needs and reduces initial stress for the juvenile. Transport and shipping require climate control, calm handling, and health certificates. If you’re planning exhibit use, these animals are exceptional ambassadors for rainforest conservation education due to their unusual physiology and gentle demeanor.</p>

<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Two-toed sloths can rotate their heads nearly 270° — handy for scanning the canopy.</li>
  <li>Their long claws are built for hanging, not digging — sloths rarely come to the ground.</li>
  <li>They host a specialized micro-ecosystem: algae, moths, and other organisms live on their fur.</li>
  <li>Sloths sometimes defecate only once a week — a risky, ritualized behavior in the wild.</li>
  <li>Mom and baby bonds are strong; juveniles often cling to their mothers for months after birth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Health & husbandry highlights: maintain consistent humidity (60–80%), provide fresh browse daily, and schedule regular exotic-animal veterinary checks. These pairs come with a full health certificate and baseline husbandry notes.

Luke & Leia are 2-year old male and female hairy porcupines, one of only a few of their species in the United States. A superb pair for breeders or private collections that can offer secure, enriched housing and a balanced high-fiber diet.",
  longDescription: `<p>The Black-tailed Hairy Dwarf Porcupine is a small New World rodent characterized by hair interspersed with defensive quills and a generally docile disposition when handled carefully. These porcupines are primarily nocturnal and arboreal; in captivity they appreciate multi-level enclosures with branches, hiding dens, and chew enrichment to wear down ever-growing incisors.</p>

<p>Dietary needs focus on high-fiber browse, leafy greens, select vegetables, and species-appropriate pellets. Leia's favorite treat is peanuts, she is so shy that she does not accept food from our hand. Calcium and vitamin monitoring is important to avoid metabolic bone issues. Enclosure design should prioritize escape prevention, secure locks (they are surprisingly strong), and substrate that allows for gentle digging/foraging behaviors. Socially, a bonded pair is ideal: it reduces stress and supports natural behaviors such as mutual grooming, they're most active in the evening.</p>

<p>From a health perspective, watch for overgrown teeth, foot lesions from inappropriate flooring, and quill breakage; routine veterinary checks with an exotics vet are essential. These porcupines make excellent educational animals when handled by experienced staff.</p>

<h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike what many expect, their quills are mostly covered by fur.</li>
  <li>The black tail is often used in signaling and balance while climbing.</li>
  <li>They are excellent climbers — provide vertical space.</li>
  <li>Porcupine pups are typically born well-furred.</li>
  <li>They use their teeth constantly — chew enrichment is essential.</li>
